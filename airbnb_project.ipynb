    "The popularity of AirBnB has transformed the landscape of short-term rentals, offering travelers accommodation and hosts an opportunity for supplementary income. This data science project delves into the dynamics of AirBnB listings in London.\n",

    "### Data Source <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section-1-1-1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify a suitable dataset for this project, I initially searched through the Kaggle.com data catalogue. There, I discovered that a user had uploaded London AirBnB listing data extracted from the web on November 6, 2023. While this was promising, the static nature of the data presented a potential challenge.\n",

    "Examining the source information provided by the user I discovered that the London listings data was being web-scraped by a site called ___Inside AirBnB___ on a monthly basis: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been actively working with the dataset obtained on September 6, 2023. However, my objective for this project is to ensure repeatability. So, one year from now, the code can be re-executed to assess the current state of the market and track its evolution.\n",
