    "To identify a suitable dataset for this project, I initially searched through the Kaggle.com data catalogue. There, I discovered that a user had uploaded London AirBnB listing data extracted from the web on November 6, 2023. While this was promising, the static nature of the data presented a potential challenge.\n",

    "I've been actively working with the dataset obtained on September 6, 2023. However, my objective for this project is to ensure repeatability. So, one year from now, the code can be re-executed to assess the current state of the market and track its evolution.\n",
